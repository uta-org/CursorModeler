    description: A complete set of non-animated XP cursors. 
                 Cursors have white bodies with black edges and 
                 a red jewel-like feature - they almost have a 
                 cartoon feel to them. Each has smooth edges 
                 and drop shadows. 15 cursors total. Enjoy.

           note: These cursors contain alpha-blended shading 
                 and will only look good in Windows XP or 
                 equivalent operating systems.

                        HOW TO INSTALL

  Copy all the cursors into your C:\WINDOWS\Cursors folder. 
  Open up Mouse properties from the Control Panel and select 
  the Pointers tab. You will now see a listing of all the 
  cursors currently being used. Going down the list, change 
  each one by highlighting it, clicking Browse, and selecting 
  the new cursor. When you're done you can save all changes 
  into a scheme for easy loading later.
